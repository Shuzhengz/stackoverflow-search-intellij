- Issues marked with either `help wanted` or `good first issue` are a great place to start!
- Issues marked with these are a great place for discussion and user suggestions

## Milestones & Version
- Milestones are how we prepare for a release and version number increment
- Issue move around milestones as we change our requirements and priorities
- Bugs always get added to the closet milestone

## Releases
- Before a release, we test on several computers making sure they all function, and all function the same
- We add a git tag to the branch and push it
- Then we draft and publish the release'
- Sometimes we will have pre-releases, but not always
